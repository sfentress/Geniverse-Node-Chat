Experiments using the node.js chat system with Geniverse.

Node.js must first be pulled from their git repo and built, using the instructions at http://www.nodejs.org/#download. I found that I had to change line 546 of the file tools/wafadmin/Tools/config_c.py from 

  proc = Utils.pproc.Popen([lastprog], *args, stdout=Utils.pproc.PIPE, stderr=Utils.pproc.PIPE)

to 

  kw = {}
  kw['stdout'] = kw['stderr'] = Utils.pproc.PIPE
  proc=Utils.pproc.Popen([lastprog],*args, **kw)

(fix was found at http://code.google.com/p/waf/issues/detail?id=626)

The original node.js chat system can be found at http://chat.nodejs.org/

After node.js has been installed, you can run the chat server:

  cd chat
  node server.js

by default, this will start the server at http://localhost:8001/
